Hi! I'm Phillip, an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland. I work on AI safety and alignment, and this past summer I was a quant trading intern at Jane Street.

My current research interests are a mixture of LLM adversarial robustness and interpretability. In adversarial robustness, I'm working on latent adversarial training to prevent jailbreaks and backdoors and to unlearn dangerous knowledge. In interpretability, I'm thinking about how to use advances in model understanding for more robust unlearning, anomaly detection, and model feature steering. 

I was previously a [ML Alignment and Theory](https://www.matsprogram.org/) scholar with Stephen Casper, a participant in [ARENA 2.0](https://www.arena.education/), and a [2022 Atlas Fellow](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
